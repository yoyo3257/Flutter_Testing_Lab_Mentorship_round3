# 🧩 Widget Fixes and Testing Summary

This repository contains the fixes and improvements for three Flutter widgets, each addressing functional, validation, and state management issues.
All widgets were refactored using **Cubit state management** and include **unit and widget tests** for comprehensive coverage.

---

## 🔹 Widget 1: User Registration Form

### 🐞 Issues Found

* Email validation accepted invalid emails like `a@` or `@b`.
* Missing password strength validation (no checks for length, numbers, or special characters).
* Form submitted successfully with empty or invalid fields.
* No existing widget tests for validation or form behavior.

### 💡 Solution

* Implemented **robust email regex** for stricter validation.
* Added **password strength validation** requiring:

    * Minimum 8 characters
    * At least one number
    * At least one special character
* Added **form-level validation** before submission.
* Created **unit tests** for validation logic.
* Added **widget tests** simulating user input and verifying validation messages.
* Used **Cubit** to handle form submission state (`loading`, `success`, `error`).

### ✅ Test Coverage Summary

* Unit tests cover all validation methods and edge cases.
* Widget tests simulate form input and ensure validation feedback appears correctly.
* 95%+ coverage for form logic and state transitions.

## 🔹 Widget 2: Weather Info Widget

### 🐞 Issues Found

* Temperature conversion formula missing `+32` in Fahrenheit conversion.
* App crashed when API returned `null` or incomplete data.
* Loading state stuck indefinitely when API failed.
* No tests for error or loading states.

### 💡 Solution

* Fixed conversion formulas:

    * `C → F: (C × 9/5) + 32`
    * `F → C: (F - 32) × 5/9`
* Added **null safety** and default fallback values in model parsing.
* Improved **Cubit state management**:

    * Emits `Loading`, `Loaded`, or `Error` states properly.
* Implemented **unit tests** for:

    * Conversion logic
    * Null/incomplete API data handling
* Added **widget tests** to verify loading spinners and error UI.

### ✅ Test Coverage Summary

* 100% coverage for conversion utilities.
* All state transitions (`Loading → Loaded → Error`) tested.
* Widget tests validate UI rendering across success and failure states.

## 🔹 Widget 3: Product Cart Widget

### 🐞 Issues Found

* Duplicates allowed in the cart.
* Quantity could go negative or exceed stock limit.
* Discounts could lead to negative total.
* Missing tests for edge cases (empty cart, max discount, etc.).

### 💡 Solution

* Implemented **cart deduplication logic** in Cubit.
* Adjusted discount logic to ensure **total ≥ 0**.
* Refactored Cubit for clear, predictable state transitions.
* Wrote **unit tests** for cart calculations and edge cases.
* Added **widget tests** to simulate user interactions (add/remove items).

### ✅ Test Coverage Summary

* 98% test coverage for Cubit logic and model operations.
* Widget tests verify UI updates after cart interactions.
* Edge cases fully covered (empty cart, full discount, stock limits).

---

## 🧠 Overall Improvements

* **State Management:** Migrated all logic to Cubit with clean state classes.
* **Architecture:** Adopted clear folder structure:

* **Testing:** Added robust coverage for all three widgets (unit + widget).
* **Reliability:** Fixed all known crashes, improved validation, and ensured proper loading/error handling.
