# Bug Fix Exercise

## Instructions

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Clone YOUR fork** (not this original repo)
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix-bug-1`
4. Fix the bugs in your code
5. Commit and push to YOUR fork
6. **Create a Pull Request within YOUR fork** (from your feature branch to your fork's main)
7. Merge it in your fork

**⚠️ Do NOT create pull requests back to this original repository!**

This is a personal exercise. Each person should maintain their own fixed version.
